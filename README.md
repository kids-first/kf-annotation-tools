This repo contains workflows and tools for variant annotation used by the Kids' First DRC.
It can be used as standalone or, if set up properly, as a git submodule for other variant call workflows.
This design allows for less code maintenance and greater ease of use.

## Annotation Workflows

Additional documentation is available for our annotation workflows:
- [Germline SNV Annotation](./docs/GERMLINE_SNV_ANNOT_README.md)
- [Somatic SNV Annotation](./docs/SOMATIC_SNV_ANNOT_README.md)
