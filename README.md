This repo contains workflows and tools for variant annotation.
It can be used as standalone or, if set up properly, as a git submodule for other variant call workflows.
This design allows for less code maintenance and greater ease of use

## Germline SNV Annotation
This workflow is for annotating germline variants. Tools and recommended refs found [here](./docs/GERMLINE_SNV_ANNOT_README.md)
